# JavaScript Frameworks Assignment 3
A fun little project consisting of recreating a mockup design with React and add a simple function to it. I chose a billboard design and put in a hip-hop style artist name generator with a developer twist. I also made it so that the colored triangles change with each new name.

- UseState
- Vite

## What I Learned
It was fun building after a mockup style, and I had a great time coming up with names. I spent a lot of time on css and small adjustments. At this time I was still adjusting to working with React and using the useState hook correctly.
